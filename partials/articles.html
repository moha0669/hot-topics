    <p>The time value of money (TVM) is the idea that money available at the present time is worth more than the same amount in the future due to its potential earning capacity. This core principle of finance holds that, provided money can earn interest, any amount of money is worth more the sooner it is received. TVM is also referred to as present discounted value. Money deposited in a savings account earns a certain interest rate. Rational investors prefer to receive money today rather than the same amount of money in the future because of money's potential to grow in value over a given period of time. Money earning an interest rate is said to be compounding in value. Depending on the exact situation in question, the TVM formula may change slightly. For example, in the case of annuity or perpetuity payments, the generalized formula has additional or less factors.

    <h1>GMO food</h1>
    <p>GMOs—or genetically modified organisms—are created in a lab by altering the genetic makeup of a plant or an animal. Ninety-two percent of Americans believe that GMO foods—widely found in kitchens across the country—should be labeled before they’re sold, according to a recent nationally representative survey of 1,004 people from the Consumer Reports National Research Center. (Last year our tests discovered that GMOs were present in many packaged foods, such as breakfast cereals, chips, baking mixes, and protein bars.)</p>

    <p>Demand for non-GMO foods has skyrocketed: In 2013, sales of non-GMO products that were either certified organic (by law, organic products can’t be made with GMO ingredients) or that carried the “Non-GMO Project Verified” seal increased by 80 percent, according to the Nutrition Business Journal. It has prompted a growing number of companies to avoid using GMOs in new products or to voluntarily reformulate existing ones so that they can sport reliable non-GMO labels. PepsiCo, for example, sells Stacy’s Simply Naked bagel and pita chips with the Non-GMO Project Verified seal; General Mills, which introduced a non-GMO original Cheerios cereal early last year, also has the non-GMO product lines Cascadian Farm and Food Should Taste Good.</p>

    <p>Yet GMO labeling has become a hot-button issue: Vermont passed a GMO labeling law last April. Last fall, the question of whether food manufacturers should be required to list GMO ingredients on their product labels was put to voters in Colorado and Oregon. On both sides were strong arguments and a lot of money spent—mostly on the part of food and chemical industry opponents to labeling. (In the Colorado election, for example, they outspent labeling supporters by about 16 to 1.) The measure was rejected in Colorado, and it failed in Oregon by a razor-thin margin in a recount—837 votes</p>

    <h1>The View of World in 2100</h1>
    <p>Think the world is crowded now? You haven’t seen anything yet.The world is expected to add another billion people within the next 15 years, bringing the total global population from 7.3 billion in mid-2015 to 8.5 billion in 2030, 9.7 billion in 2050, and 11.2 billion by 2100, according to new estimates from the UN.</p>

    <p>Currently, 60 percent of the global population lives in Asia, 16 percent in Africa, 10 percent in Europe, 9 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean, and only 5 percent in North America and Oceania. China and India are the largest countries in the world, together making up almost 40 percent of the world population.The world population is growing at a gradually slower and slower pace, but it's still growing substantially. Currently, the world adds about 83 million people per year, equivalent to roughly the population of Germany.</p>

    <p>But population growth has slowed to 1.18 percent per year from 1.24 percent a decade ago. The UN expects population growth to continue to gradually level off. Global population is almost sure to rise in the short term but the UN says there is a 1 in 4 chance that the world population will stabilize or fall before 2100. How accurate are these predictions? In the past, the UN has had a pretty good track record with its population predictions, as In 1948 it projected world population would be around 6 billion in 2000, only less than five percent off from what it was that year, Khokar points out. As the saying goes, past performance is no guarantee. There are a few factors that could skew these results. One that the UN mentions in its report is how fast the birth rate falls in countries where women currently have a lot of kids. The UN is expecting fertility to fall substantially, but that will hinge on things like investments in women’s health and expanded access to birth control.</p>
